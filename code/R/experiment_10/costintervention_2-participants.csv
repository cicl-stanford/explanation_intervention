3020,Condition_2,18,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
2965,Condition_2,26,Non-Hispanic,I decided to respond the way I did based on the information I was given throughout the experiment.,Female,White,
2997,Condition_2,47,Non-Hispanic,"I figured if I told her it was due to the blue switch, she would be more likely to choose it if she had to choose one, thus costing us less",Male,White,
2957,Condition_2,34,Non-Hispanic,none,Male,White,
2973,Condition_2,33,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
2923,Condition_2,41,Non-Hispanic,"We only need one switch to be on to win the $5, so both explanations are equally good.",Female,White,
2961,Condition_2,56,Non-Hispanic,Either switch turned on will result in the money gained. ,Female,White,
2931,Condition_2,40,Non-Hispanic,Factors based on my understanding of the game.,Male,White,
3006,Condition_2,25,Non-Hispanic,Just that both switches have the same chance of turning on,Female,White,
2993,Condition_2,42,Non-Hispanic,The rules and probabilities influenced my responses. No additional comments.,Male,White,
2941,Condition_2,32,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
2949,Condition_2,55,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
2933,Condition_2,38,Non-Hispanic,They were both on so either statement would be true.,Female,Multiracial,
3016,Condition_2,25,Non-Hispanic,I would say this to try to influence Alice to turn on the less expensive Blue switch.,Female,White,
2969,Condition_2,49,Non-Hispanic,"Saying blue will make it more likely Alice will flip the blue switch, which will cost only $1",Female,White,
3001,Condition_2,41,Non-Hispanic,I tried to emphasize the importance of the blue switch being on so that hopefully Alice would turn that one on with her choice since it was lower cost. I wasn't sure if I was allowed to directly address the price.,Male,White,
2937,Condition_2,40,Non-Hispanic,I suggested the blue switch be turned on as it costs less then the orange and my partner doesn't know this info so I've relayed it without giving it away,Male,Multiracial,
3012,Condition_2,74,Non-Hispanic,no,Female,White,
2927,Condition_2,46,Non-Hispanic,I would tell her the blue switch needs to be on because it costs less,Female,White,
2981,Condition_2,42,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
3008,Condition_2,27,Non-Hispanic,"I responded because there since we won $5, both switches turned on. Alice already knew the likelihood of that happening, and the cost of flipping a switch did not come into play. Had I turned a switch manually, it would be relevant to mention the cost or specific switch.",Male,White,
2945,Condition_2,35,Non-Hispanic,Just reading the directions,Female,White,
2985,Condition_2,62,Non-Hispanic,just curious where we are going with the game...,Female,White,
3023,Condition_3,37,Non-Hispanic,You would want to always use the orange switch so if thats all you could say you would want to convey to always use the orange switch.,Male,White,
2972,Condition_3,33,Non-Hispanic,,Female,Black/African American,
2995,Condition_3,21,Hispanic,That the orange switch is cheaper,Male,White,
2979,Condition_3,30,Non-Hispanic,"Both switches had the same likelihood of turning ON, and since the total outcome was based on chance we can't assign more credit to either switch.",Male,White,
2991,Condition_3,53,Non-Hispanic,"I couldn't remember which switch we turned on manually in the first round, so I couldn't remember which explanation to give Zarah. I assumed I wasn't supposed to press the back button.  So I said either explanation would be okay.",Female,White,
2930,Condition_3,44,Non-Hispanic,,other_gender,White,
2925,Condition_3,40,Non-Hispanic,I responded with an answer that was true. No,Female,Asian,
2984,Condition_3,43,Non-Hispanic,Just wanted to make sure they knew the basics of the game.,Male,White,
2918,Condition_3,58,Non-Hispanic,You win with both on so either is fine,Female,White,
2988,Condition_3,62,,Because both would have the same comprehension of why.,Female,White,
2964,Condition_3,47,Non-Hispanic,I wanted to make sure Zarah turned on the orange switch because it only costs $1 to do so,Male,White,
2922,Condition_3,29,Non-Hispanic,i answered that way because i wouldve chosen to flip the orange switch,Female,Black/African American,
2934,Condition_3,44,Hispanic,Both statements are true. the cost doesn't matter at that point. ,Female,White,
2960,Condition_3,52,Non-Hispanic,,Female,Black/African American,
2948,Condition_3,31,Non-Hispanic,Respond to make my partner pick the orange switch.,Male,Asian,
2952,Condition_3,24,Non-Hispanic,"I would tell Zarah that the orange switch being flipped on is the reason that we won, because perhaps then she will be more inclined to choose orange (which is cheaper than blue) to flip the switch.",Male,White,
3005,Condition_3,31,Non-Hispanic,Both switches had the same high probability to turn on so I wouldn't want her to pay to manually turn the switch on.,Male,White,
3018,Condition_3,23,Hispanic,No factors ,Male,Multiracial,
2956,Condition_3,28,Non-Hispanic,I wanted to emphasize the importance of the cheaper switch,Non-binary,White,
2976,Condition_3,72,Non-Hispanic,,Female,Black/African American,
3014,Condition_3,30,Non-Hispanic,"Cost, it was cheaper to turn on the orange switch. More of a reward",Male,White,
2944,Condition_3,31,Non-Hispanic,Becuase she has control over the blue switch ,Male,White,
2999,Condition_3,33,Non-Hispanic,Just trying to simplify & not make things complicated for the other player.,Female,Black/African American,
2940,Condition_3,42,Non-Hispanic,"I would say that we won because the orange switch turned on so that she would be more likely to choose that one in subsequent rounds to turn on, since it costs less money to choose that switch.",Female,White,
2974,Condition_4,30,Non-Hispanic,None,Female,White,
2921,Condition_4,23,Non-Hispanic,if alice did not know the price of the switches and i wasn't directly able to let her know it would make more sense for me to lead her to believe the the orange won us the five dollars. as it would be in both of our best interests do flip only the orange switch since it costs less,Male,Multiracial,
2946,Condition_4,34,Non-Hispanic,i want her to turn on the orange one.,Female,White,
3002,Condition_4,29,Non-Hispanic,Whichever outcome produced the most money and costed the least.,Male,Black/African American,
2932,Condition_4,57,Non-Hispanic,If either switch turned on we win so it doesn't matter which one.,Male,White,
2998,Condition_4,32,Non-Hispanic,I told Alice what I could to try to influence her to try the orange switch more than the blue so that we could potentially win more money. ,Female,Black/African American,
2966,Condition_4,42,Non-Hispanic,We needed at least one switch to turn on so if either turned on it would be equally as good.,Female,White,
2958,Condition_4,25,Non-Hispanic,"Indicating we won due to the orange switch may influence Alex's decision to choose the orange switch, which is favorable as it has a lower cost to pull.",Male,White,
2994,Condition_4,36,Non-Hispanic,it cost less money to turn the orange switch on,Female,Black/African American,
2950,Condition_4,42,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
2982,Condition_4,50,Non-Hispanic,Both explanations were equal,Male,White,

3017,Condition_4,29,Non-Hispanic,No questions/comments,Male,Asian,
2924,Condition_4,29,Non-Hispanic,"The probability of both switches turning on was the same, so I felt that either answer would be sufficient in this regard.",Male,Multiracial,
2986,Condition_4,41,,"it seemed that either would be sufficient since they both do the same thing, minus the cost variant.",Male,White,
3021,Condition_4,33,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
2990,Condition_4,32,Non-Hispanic,Whether the switch was on,Male,White,
2978,Condition_4,70,Non-Hispanic,Either switch being on would yield a prize.,Male,White,
2939,Condition_4,41,Hispanic,"the basic rules of the game. if one is turned on, we win",Male,White,
2942,Condition_4,60,,Easiest to explain,Male,White,
3003,Condition_4,44,Non-Hispanic,"It costs less to turn the orange switch on, so there's no reason to even bother with the blue switch since only 1 needs to be on.",Male,White,
3013,Condition_4,50,Non-Hispanic,I considered the fact that Alice already had some information ,Male,White,
2962,Condition_4,34,Hispanic,,Male,Multiracial,
2936,Condition_4,43,Non-Hispanic,each answer would give the same outcome,Female,White,
3009,Condition_4,46,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
2967,Condition_1,42,Non-Hispanic,the factors that influenced how i decided to respond were the instructions given to me in the study,Female,White,
2996,Condition_1,30,,"Reason I said blue was because that is the one I specifically turned on, hoping to hint to her to use the blue switch. If the game continued, I would assume she would turn ON the blue switch then I could turn the orange switch to win.",Male,White,
3000,Condition_1,36,Non-Hispanic,"Since Z doesn't know which switch costs more, telling them to focus on Blue is probably better, even though it's not exactly true. As an aside, the consent form mentions the experiment would last 10-15 min, which is definitely not true.",Non-binary,Asian,
2917,Condition_1,36,Non-Hispanic,I thought that since both switches had to be on to win money then the explanation of why it turned on would be that both switches were turned on. I thought that it would be the same amount of meaning no matter if I told her that it was because of the blue switch or the orange switch because both needed to be on to win.,Female,White,
2935,Condition_1,35,Non-Hispanic,Blue costs less to turn on than the orange does. ,Female,White,
2983,Condition_1,25,Non-Hispanic,,Male,Black/African American,
2938,Condition_1,75,Non-Hispanic,"One of the worst surveys of the thousands I have done. It made no sense,",Male,White,
2971,Condition_1,38,Non-Hispanic,no,Female,White,
2975,Condition_1,33,Non-Hispanic,I felt that keeping it simple was the best bet since there was an 80% chance of both switches turning on.,Male,Multiracial,
2926,Condition_1,27,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
3004,Condition_1,24,,"Switching the syntax mid way through made it a bit confusing. ex: ""Win $5"" to ""win a point""",Female,Asian,
3007,Condition_1,52,Non-Hispanic,I wanted to focus on clear communication,Male,White,
2987,Condition_1,26,Non-Hispanic,I have no question.,Male,Black/African American,
2943,Condition_1,50,Non-Hispanic,It's both an 80 percent chance.  So pretty equal.,Female,White,
2959,Condition_1,60,Non-Hispanic,Because it would be cheaper to turn on the blue switch and we would win more money.,Female,White,
2929,Condition_1,70,Non-Hispanic,,Male,Black/African American,
2947,Condition_1,31,Non-Hispanic,,Female,Black/African American,
2951,Condition_1,45,Non-Hispanic,"Because we manually turned on the BLUE switch, it's about letting her know that we won based on the random switching of the orange switch.",Male,White,
2980,Condition_1,33,Non-Hispanic,"Both switches being on is a good thing, so it is beneficial to let Zarah know that, especially since she doesn't seem to know about the switch costs.",Male,White,
3019,Condition_1,26,Non-Hispanic,the cost of the lever,Male,Asian,
3015,Condition_1,47,Non-Hispanic,The switch needs to be turned on regardless to On.  The blue one is cheaper.,Female,White,
3011,Condition_1,63,Non-Hispanic,I felt that would incentivize Zarah to turn on blue which would be less expensive. ,Male,White,
2992,Condition_1,35,Non-Hispanic,"I tried to influence my partner to try to win the money, and spend the least amount of money.",Female,White,
2920,Condition_1,32,Non-Hispanic,We won because the orange switch turned *itself* on; I turned on the blue one by myself.,Female,White,
