2575,Condition1,45,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
2569,Condition1,61,Non-Hispanic,I picked the answers that logically made sense to me.,Female,White,
2595,Condition1,27,Non-Hispanic,I thought about what made most sense given the scenraio.,Male,Multiracial,
2537,Condition1,49,Non-Hispanic,I just made my responses based on how it would get the other partcipant to press the button that would increase our chances most.,Female,White,

2635,Condition1,26,Non-Hispanic,,Male,Black/African American,
2555,Condition1,33,Non-Hispanic,"The probability of both colors to be switched ""On"" was the driving factor behind the way I chose to respond. Because the blue already had a high probability to switch on, it was important to give the orange color the boost by pushing the button so that it too had a high probability to switch on. ",Female,White,
2626,Condition1,20,Non-Hispanic,None,Male,Multiracial,
2611,Condition1,27,Non-Hispanic,"I was trying to have the highest possibility of one or both of the lights turning on, depending on what was needed. ",Non-binary,White,
2543,Condition1,35,Non-Hispanic,I was trying to simplify my responses as easily as possible.,Non-binary,White,
2622,Condition1,48,Non-Hispanic,This was interesting!,Female,White,
2630,Condition1,30,Non-Hispanic,"Since both switches were on both times, it didn't matter what the probability was. Both switches being on gave us points, regardless of the color.  ",Female,White,
2579,Condition1,25,Non-Hispanic,n/a,Female,White,
2620,Condition1,53,Non-Hispanic,I chose the third option because it was accurate.,Male,White,
2563,Condition1,28,Non-Hispanic,"I often pressed the orange button to increase the probability to 90% because I knew the blue switch would still have a high probability of 80%. No, I have no more questions nor comments. ",Female,White,
2571,Condition1,38,Non-Hispanic,"In the first one I said orange one turned on because it was more vital for the orange to turn on due to the low chance without the button pressed. The second one, just needed one to turn on so it was okay to say because either one turned on. ",Male,White,
2593,Condition1,22,Non-Hispanic,I tried to think logically about the probability and how it would or would not change with each scenario.,Female,White,
2632,Condition1,57,Non-Hispanic,I was influenced by the higher percentages. No additional comments.,Male,Black/African American,
2615,Condition1,42,Non-Hispanic,The best one to score points,Male,White,
2616,Condition1,25,Non-Hispanic,Depending on the rules to earn points is how i responded,Female,Black/African American,
2605,Condition1,50,Non-Hispanic,Tried to follow the instructions and make percentages better,Male,White,
2640,Condition1,65,Non-Hispanic,"In both cases, it improves chances of winning significantly if the orange switch probability goes from 20% to 90%. I'd answer the question ""because the orange switch..."" to signal my partner that she should press the orange button in the next round.",Male,White,
2591,Condition1,26,Non-Hispanic,I choose the most straight forward answer,Female,Asian,
2561,Condition1,32,Hispanic,,Male,White,

2599,Condition1,19,Non-Hispanic,My judgement,Male,White,
2634,Condition1,23,Non-Hispanic,"I was trying to choose the option that would lead to her being more likely to press the orange button. I considered that she might think that the orange switch doesn't need any extra manipulation if I told her that we won because of it. I decided to still go with that option though because I thought it would be more likely that she would want the orange switch to keep turning on, leading to her pressing the orange button instead of the blue one.",Female,White,
2573,Condition1,28,Non-Hispanic,I wanted to encourage them to click the orange button so they probability of both switches would be high,Female,White,
2557,Condition1,21,Non-Hispanic,I was influenced by the percentages for each lever and how much the other person knew,Female,White,
2559,Condition1,20,Non-Hispanic,I chose to explain that the orange one caused the win; I thought this would influence my teammate to increase winning chances further by pressing the orange button. Pressing it is always the best choice (both switches needed and one switch needed).,Male,Asian,
2551,Condition1,55,Non-Hispanic,The probability was always higher with the blue button.,Female,Black/African American,
2553,Condition1,34,Non-Hispanic,I responded based on my own judgements and on the information provided. I felt that the experiment was asymmetrically favored to make the player push the button that had the higher probability. ,Male,Asian,
2589,Condition1,41,Non-Hispanic,"I just went for the best odds, and if something had fewer odds of being turned ""on"", I tried to respond in a way which would encourage my teammate to push that button to increase it's odds.",Female,White,
2639,Condition1,39,Non-Hispanic,Depending on what the other person knew ,Female,White,
2583,Condition1,26,Non-Hispanic,"I responded based on what seemed like it was most likely to get the best outcome, which was usually pressing the orange button.",Male,White,
2587,Condition1,23,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
2613,Condition1,28,Non-Hispanic,The button was basically an easy chance to have both switches on no matter the round.,Male,White,
2539,Condition1,41,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
2545,Condition1,27,Non-Hispanic,I felt like the options were both technically right. No questions.,Female,White,
2577,Condition1,40,Hispanic,so i guess this was to see if the rules of the game were easy to understand.,Male,White,
2597,Condition1,22,Non-Hispanic,"I thought mentioning orange as the one that helped us gain a point would be better regardless of the situation, as it was the one with the lower percentage. If they thought we won because of the orange switch turning on, they'd be more likely to press the orange button next time.",Male,White,

2592,Condition2,45,Non-Hispanic,We are better off pressing the orange switch.,Male,White,
2602,Condition2,30,Non-Hispanic,I chose the easiest explanation. It didn't matter if my teammate knew all the rules because the outcome wouldn't change.,Female,Black/African American,
2594,Condition2,33,Non-Hispanic,I answered based on probabilities. ,Female,White,
2612,Condition2,31,Non-Hispanic,It was less likely for the orange switch to turn on. ,Male,Black/African American,
2590,Condition2,25,Hispanic,I want to see which is optimal and which is the best explanation.,Male,Multiracial,
2548,Condition2,29,Non-Hispanic,The experiment is really educative,Male,White,
2614,Condition2,39,Non-Hispanic,Neither answer was true in the last round. Both had to be on,Male,White,
2584,Condition2,29,Non-Hispanic,I gave the switch color that had more impact on the outcome.,Female,Asian,
2617,Condition2,58,Non-Hispanic,the instructions provided. no questions,Male,White,
2542,Condition2,27,Non-Hispanic,Explaining that the we won because a certain switch was on was a true explanation to give. ,Female,White,
2568,Condition2,28,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
2574,Condition2,42,Non-Hispanic,I tried to go by the information that I read.,Female,Black/African American,
2604,Condition2,31,Non-Hispanic,The main factor for me was that the orange button definitely needs the button pressed to have a higher chance of winning.,Female,Multiracial,
2562,Condition2,37,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
2560,Condition2,51,Non-Hispanic,I would respond that the orange switch was more important to try to influence the other player to click the orange button even if they didn't understand why.  ,Male,White,
2558,Condition2,21,Non-Hispanic,the likelihood of a switch turning on helped me decide my response.,Female,Asian,
2638,Condition2,32,Non-Hispanic,"Obviously in both instances you wanted to have the best probability that both switches could in fact turn on, so I wanted to maximize my chances of that. I do believe I misclicked on the last occasion that I was asked about that, I meant to say that I would click the button to turn the orange switch to on, that way there would be the highest probability of both switches turning on. Regardless, it was mainly important to achieve the highest percentage probability that both switches would turn on.",Male,White,
2619,Condition2,67,Non-Hispanic,that one was always 90% chance of winning and it didn't really matter which one,Female,White,
2610,Condition2,28,Hispanic,To quickly persuade the person to make the smarter choice. ,Male,White,
2629,Condition2,25,Non-Hispanic,I wanted to subtly imply to my teammate that the orange switch turning on is more critically important because it has a lower probability.,Female,Black/African American,

2598,Condition2,41,Non-Hispanic,Trying to maximize chance of positive outcome,Male,White,
2576,Condition2,38,Non-Hispanic,"Because the blue switch is more likely to be on, saying the orange switch needs to be on makes them more likely to press the orange button, thus improving the overall odds.",Male,White,
2608,Condition2,22,Non-Hispanic,The factors was mostly if both sides managed to go to the on side which would have gotten the win.,Male,White,
2631,Condition2,24,Non-Hispanic,,Female,Black/African American,
2556,Condition2,43,Non-Hispanic,"The only factors that influenced how I chose to respond were my own reasoning skills, whether that was good or bad. I do not have any questions or comments regarding this study.",Female,White,

2580,Condition2,,,the button pressing moving it up to 90%. if either of the people press the orange button it dramatically increases the chances,other_gender,other_race,
2621,Condition2,41,Non-Hispanic,I tried to think about what information my partner would need to press the correct button on a second turn.,Female,White,
2578,Condition2,33,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
2554,Condition2,39,Non-Hispanic,I was just thinking about emphasizing the orange switch so the teammate would be more likely to press the orange button,Non-binary,White,

2623,Condition2,24,Non-Hispanic,If the information I can provide would be helpful to my partner.,Male,Asian,
2570,Condition2,30,Non-Hispanic,I answered any way I could to try and get my teammate to press the button that turned the orange switch to a likelihood of 90% turning on since the blue switch was already highly likely to turn on. ,Female,White,
2566,Condition2,29,Hispanic,Both answers sounded fair since both options needed to be on it wouldn't make sense to say one color had the most impact,Male,other_race,
2536,Condition2,24,Non-Hispanic,"The blue switch already had an 80% chance of turning on which is pretty high, whereas the orange only had 20%. If I could increase the orange to 90%, then I would have an 80% and a 90% which significantly increases the likelihood of winning points. Each decision I made was to try and influence my partner to choose the button for the orange switch",Female,White,
2588,Condition2,27,Hispanic,"In other rounds it would be better for my teammate to select the blue switch, so it would be best to say that even if it's not the whole story.",Male,White,

2636,Condition2,36,Non-Hispanic,I just determine what will give us the highest probability of winning and go by that. ,Female,White,
