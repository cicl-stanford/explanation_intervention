2728,Condition_3,32,Non-Hispanic,The information I had influenced my response. i wanted to make sure that the statistics were lessened if they were high and lower the probability of losing,Female,White,
2658,Condition_3,21,Non-Hispanic,"The instructions were overly complicated, which I only realized at the end confused my answer. ",Female,White,
2717,Condition_3,49,Non-Hispanic,Pushing the blue button has the greater influence on the stated odds,Male,White,
2769,Condition_3,62,Non-Hispanic,I chose because I knew which switch was more likely to be turned on,Female,White,
2719,Condition_3,39,Non-Hispanic,"The percentages on the blue button were much more impactful at 80% of being on vs 20%, so i tried to limit that as much as possible by recommending the blue button be pressed to reduce to 10%. ",Male,White,
2713,Condition_3,51,Non-Hispanic,Blue seemed most likely to be on with 80% ,Female,White,
2748,Condition_3,34,Non-Hispanic,"The wording on the explanation of lowering the on chance % was a bit ambiguous. During the first explanation, I was under the impression pressing the button decreased the on chance BY 10% rather than TO 10%. Had I recognized that, I would have chosen blue so that blue would have 10% on chance and the orange a 20% on chance to optimally minimize the chances of losing a point. ",Male,Multiracial,
2690,Condition_3,31,Non-Hispanic,I decided based on what made the most logical sense to inform the other partner.,Female,White,
2672,Condition_3,62,Non-Hispanic,"The blue switch always has a higher probability of turning on, so if turning on causes point loss it would be best to choose to press blue button to lower probability of on.  The orange always has a lower probability of turning on so no need to press the orange button",Female,Black/African American,
2740,Condition_3,33,Hispanic,The percentage of the probability each color would turn on. ,Male,Black/African American,
2675,Condition_3,27,Hispanic,I feel like the obvious answer would be to say because both turned on but I hovered towards blue since it was more likely to turn on,Male,other_race,
2772,Condition_3,29,Hispanic,Doing some math to find the odds,Male,Multiracial,
2757,Condition_3,40,Non-Hispanic,The blue switch needed to be manipulated the most in order to achieve the highest chance of both being off.,Male,White,

2727,Condition_3,30,Non-Hispanic,My responses simply depended on if it was true or not. ,Male,White,
2694,Condition_3,59,Non-Hispanic,I mainly looked at the percentage it would take to turn each switch on.,Female,White,
2668,Condition_3,29,Non-Hispanic,factors - just reading and picking the best result and answering the questions. there is still a 50/50 chance of us having the switch on at the same time.,Female,Black/African American,
2733,Condition_3,54,Non-Hispanic,I think the higher percentage of the blue carried more weight in whether it would turn on or not.  ,Female,White,
2711,Condition_3,23,Non-Hispanic,The number of switches that had to be on to lose a point changed the way I communicated with my team mate. ,Female,White,
