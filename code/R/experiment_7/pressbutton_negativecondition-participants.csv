2508,Condition_4,21,Non-Hispanic,"In the second scenario with Zarah, we can easily reduce the orange's probability to zero and therefore guarantee that we do not lose a point. In the first, I thought pressing the blue button would be better so that it is less certain that the blue button turns on",Female,White,
2455,Condition_4,53,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
2475,Condition_4,54,Non-Hispanic,"I told Zarah that we lost a point because Orange turned on in the hopes that she would turn it off in future rounds to reduce the chance of happening again to 0%, so we wouldn't lose any more points. Interesting, different study.",Male,White,

2492,Condition_4,60,Non-Hispanic,"I just decided how to respond based on a which felt right.

During the 2nd round with Zhara, I might have been confused, on what knowledge she had of the probability/teammate's knowledge.",Female,White,
2510,Condition_4,38,Non-Hispanic,"No, I did make a mistake though.  In the slightly different version of the game I should have selected the switch for the orange one to make it impossible to turn on.  that was a lapse in judgement on my part but I couldn't go back to fix it.  When answering about which explanation to use, I chose the one that had the color name in it that needed to have the switch pressed in the hope that they would take that as a hint to just press that colors switch.",Male,White,

2516,Condition_4,35,Non-Hispanic,My reasoning is that my partner would be more inclined to press the blue button if I blamed that button for losing points. This would lead to better odds of the blue switch staying off.,Male,White,

2532,Condition_3,40,Non-Hispanic,"I responded that the blue switch being turned on caused the team to lose a point the first time because the blue switch had an 80% chance of being turned on and both switches needed to be on to lose the point. It was less likely the orange switch would be turned on.

For the second answer, I said both blue or orange turned on equally caused the point to be lost as either switch turned on would lose a point.",Male,White,
2524,Condition_3,32,Non-Hispanic,"The explanations seemed a bit awkward. Unless it was part of the study, why not just state that we needed both switches to be ""off"" in order to not lose a point?",Male,other_race,
