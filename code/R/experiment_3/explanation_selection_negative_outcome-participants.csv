1549,Disneg_Conneg,27,Non-Hispanic,"I assumed if I told her it was because the blue switch turned on, that's the switch she would manually turn to off in the next round. That way, the blue switch is off and no matter which way the orange switch goes, we won't lose a point. ",Non-binary,White,
1565,Disneg_Conneg,22,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
1539,Disneg_Conneg,25,Non-Hispanic,"I was mostly focused on the orange switch due to its lower chance of switching on. Looking back, I would've explained to the other player that the point was lost due to the blue switch.",Female,Asian,

1468,Disneg_Conneg,33,Non-Hispanic,"I think it is more like a ""blaming"" game, like we are trying to figure out what we find is blamable.

1472,Disneg_Conneg,46,Non-Hispanic,I thought there would be more rounds to the game and telling the first player it was the blue one would maker her less likely to turn blue on which I don't know even has any effect on whether or not the machine actually turns to on.

1554,Conneg_Disneg,51,Non-Hispanic,if you want to play an honest game you tell the truth as far as picking the one with the most likely to turn on. i was confused because you said  at first we worked together then you said I scored a point. which would mean i stole her point so we were actually competitors.,Female,White,
