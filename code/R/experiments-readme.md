Information about each of the experiment that is run as part of this project.

Experiment 1: Missing --- was it turned into Experiment 1b?

Experiment 1b: "Hard Interventions"
"The Influence of Outcome Valence on Explanation Selection in Positive / Negative Outcome Cases"
People select a hard intervention that turns the switch ON or OFF in Conjunctive and Disjunctive Structures with positive and negative outcomes.
Condition 1: Con/Pos , Dis/Pos
Condition 2: Dis/Pos , Con/Pos
Condition 3: Con/Neg , Dis/Neg
Condition 4: Dis/Neg , Con/Neg
