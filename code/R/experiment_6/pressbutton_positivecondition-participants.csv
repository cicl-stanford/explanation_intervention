2353,Condition_2,20,Hispanic,"The blue switch had a higher chance of switching on, therefore i always answered that the blue switch was the reason we won the point.

With Alice since only one switch needed to be on, and orange had the lesser odds, I wanted her to think that the orange switch was good, and have her press the blue button so it would be 100%",Female,White,

2359,Condition_2,21,Non-Hispanic,"My response varied based on which switch having an increased chance of turning on would be better for the scenario. For example, changing the blue switch to have an 100% chance of turning on is the best thing to do in the first scenario in order to get the largest number of points, so I told my partner that we won because the blue switch turned on.
