One other comment: some of the last few comprehension questions are phrased either awkwardly or (in my understanding) inaccurately. There are questions asking if I and Alice know that BOTH swtiches need to be on to win $5; from my understanding of the instructions however, this is untrue: only one switch needs to be on to win $5.
